Numerical Methods
Taught by Ken Jackson at UofT

The study of computational methods for solving problems in linear algebra, non-linear equations, and approximation. The aim is to give students a basic understanding of both floating-point arithmetic and the implementation of algorithms used to solve numerical problems, as well as a familiarity with current numerical computing environments.

In this course assignments has to be done in matlab using linear algebra and accurate floating point calculation techniques.
